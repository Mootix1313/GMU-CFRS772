# George Mason University - Digital Forensics and Cyber Analysis (MS)

This repository contains each project submission for my Python Forensics Course (DFCA 772) at [George Mason University][1]. I was a student in DFCA 772 in the spring of 2019.

## Projects

The projects start out as very introductory to Python, but increase in difficulty/complexity as more projects are introduced.

*   HW1 - Basic Introduction to Python Concepts
*   HW2 - Simple Binary and Text Searching
*   HW3 - User Interaction Through three games: Math Expressions, Hex Conversions, Binary Conversions
*   HW4 - Creating Unit Tests for HW2 Functions
*   HW5 - Creating a parser for the Windows "setupapi.app.log" file
*   HW6 - Reading and parsing PCAP files to extract the data portion of ICMP packets
*   HW7 - E_THREAD and E_PROCESS block extraction from a Windows memory image
*   HW8 - Retrieval of JPGs from a user provided URL, and checking for appended data
*   HW9 - Parsing a PCAP file for unique IP and MAC addresses, which are saved to an sqlite3 database
*   HW10 - File type detection between a bmp, txt, a specific keylog, a specific process monitoring log, and a screenshot
